Instant GLEW
============

My book [Instant GLEW](http://www.packtpub.com/how-to-deploy-opengl-extensions-using-glew/book)
helps you learn how to utilize OpenGL extensions in graphics programs effortlessly by using
the [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) library.

The source code files used in the book are shared here:

* teapot: Source code files of the grey teapot example
* teapotglew: Source code files of the teapot example that uses GLEW to do toon shading
* glew-1.10.0: Header, library and DLL files of GLEW 1.10.0
* freeglut-2.8.1: Header, library and DLL files of FreeGLUT 2.8.1 compiled for Visual Studio 2012

Setup
=====

These source files have been tested with both Visual Studio 2012 and Visual Studio Express 2012 for Desktop.
They should work on older versions of Visual Studio if you can create the needed solution files.
They should work with Linux and Mac OS X too, if you can compile and link the files.
